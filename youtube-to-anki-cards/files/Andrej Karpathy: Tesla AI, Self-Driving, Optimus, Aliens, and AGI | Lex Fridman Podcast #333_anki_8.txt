How do you focus resources in developing autonomous driving technology? ; Focus on computer vision as it is both necessary and sufficient. Bringing in other sensors costs more and may not be necessary.
Is it practical to pre-map environments for autonomous driving at centimeter level accuracy? ; No, it is a massive dependency and a distraction. It is useful to have low-level maps for connectivity and road navigation, but pre-mapping high resolution maps is unnecessary.
What have you learned about maintaining efficient organizations from working with Elon Musk? ; The fight against entropy in an organization is important, and simplifying processes and removing inefficiencies is key.
What is the value of setting seemingly impossible goals in problem-solving? ; Setting ambitious goals is valuable because hard problems are not always 10x harder to execute on. It can force a reevaluation of approaches and lead to more scalable solutions.
What is the timeline for solving the problem of autonomous driving? ; It is hard to forecast, but it feels tractable and the team at Tesla is on track to solving it.
How do you build intuition to make predictions about tractability in problem-solving? ; It is about studying, looking at sample data, and building belief in the solution to the problem. Expert intuition is key.
What is the frontier of improvement in autonomous driving technology? ; The focus is on improving efficiency and scalability in data and compute, as well as addressing human factor issues such as night driving, recognizing pedestrian behavior, and improving sober driving. Progress is being made, but there is still work to be done.
