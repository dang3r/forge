The transcript discusses the role of programming in software 2.0 systems and the importance of data collection and annotation in training neural networks for autonomous vehicles. The task of programming a software 2.0 system involves changing data sets and loss functions rather than writing commands line by line. The Autopilot system for Tesla involves collecting massive data sets for object detection, lane markings, and traffic lights, and using the data to train neural nets for prediction tasks. The data annotation process is a major part of the software 2.0 world and involves creating large, accurate, and diverse data sets for supervised learning. The annotation process involves a lot of human input but also uses offline reconstruction software to track objects over time. Cameras are a cheap and high-bandwidth sensor but have limitations, and the design of autonomous vehicles depends heavily on visual input. The strengths and limitations of a pixel-based approach to driving include a powerful prior for how the world evolves over time. Some open problems in the space of data annotation include co-designing tasks that are easy for humans to perform and ensuring that diverse and accurate data sets are used.
