What does McLean's book, "The Vital Question", argue about the origin of life? ; It argues that the basic chemistry needed for the origin of life is actually not rare and can be seen in other systems. 
How long after the formation of Earth did primitive life arise, according to McLean's book? ; A few hundred million years. 
What is the current belief among scientists regarding the frequency of life in the universe? ; It should be fairly common. 
What is the most difficult jump in biological evolution, according to some biologists? ; From bacteria to more complex organisms, such as eukaryotes. 
What is the main reason why we have not found any other intelligent life in the universe? ; Our ability to measure it and observe it is limited. 
What makes interstellar travel so difficult? ; The interstellar medium, cosmic radiation, and the difficulty in shielding against high-speed particles. 
What would be the first instinct for a scientist upon discovering intelligent alien life? ; To probe it and interact with it to learn more about it. 
What is the current view on Earth's status in the universe? ; An incredibly interesting and unique story that took a long time to evolve, and it should be preserved if possible. 
What is a possible story of the Earth's trajectory, once its computation is complete? ; It is a chemically diverse environment where complex dynamical systems can evolve and become more complex, with trends pointing towards terminating conditions, but the story is not yet fully known. 
Why are humans often referred to as a "biological bootloader for AI"? ; Because while humans are capable of computation and have created advanced machines, they are extremely inefficient compared to computers.
