The transcript discusses the challenges of driving from a perception and vision standpoint, as well as the difficulties of building and maintaining a robust data engine to perfect training sets. The removal of certain sensors is seen as a way to simplify and optimize the product as a whole. The role of humans in the iterative process of improving the data engine is also emphasized.

1. What is the data engine and what role does it play in training neural networks?
2. What is the role of humans in the data engine process?
3. How does simplifying the product by removing certain sensors improve the overall efficiency of the system?
4. Why is deploying a large fleet of vehicles with sensors important for collecting data for the data engine?
5. Why is vision seen as both necessary and sufficient for driving?
