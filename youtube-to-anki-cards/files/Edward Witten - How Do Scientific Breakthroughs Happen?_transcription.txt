ed uh you began as a history major at brandeis and then you won the fields medal which is in mathematics uh and were the only physicists to have won a fields medal how did that transition happen well after some hesitations i recognized that the age of about 21 that my talent was really in math and physics and that's the direction i should go in and i went to graduate school in physics because i was excited about the elementary particles now i started graduate school in 1973 and something to bear in mind is that the 50s 60s and early 70s were an incredible period of discovery in elementary particle physics all kinds of things were discovered uh new particles new forces new properties remember something specific at the time that excited you to make that transition well when i made the decision to be a physicist i didn't possibly know much more about elementary particles than you do or somebody else who hasn't studied them seriously so i knew that there were a lot of discoveries but i had only hazy idea what the discoveries were the period of discovery continued after i was a graduate student and there was a dramatic discovery made in the fall of my second year the so-called jci particle and perhaps we'll come back to that in a moment but what i want to capture is that there was this incredible period of ferment in almighty particles which what drove me into the subject and it also led to the discovery of the standard model of particle physics where the finishing touches were being applied almost as i was starting graduate school so asymptotic freedom the last big breakthrough was discovered by gross wilcheck and pulitzer literally a few months before i started graduate school and it took another year before i knew enough to understand what was going on in the physics world and then conveniently time just a little bit after that was another huge experimental discovery a new particle called the jsi which was simultaneously discovered in two different laboratories at brookhaven and in california it had seemingly paradoxical properties but it turned out it had a very natural explanation in the standard model and by some yardsticks it was a clincher in showing that this gender model was correct so physics was in a new landscape by the time i was really understanding it the standard model was in place and was coming to be relatively well established but the standard model involved new mathematics that was that physicists were using in constructing the standard model but that was quite unfamiliar to physicists and also at that time to mathematicians and whose exploration turned out to be very rich so what specifically was the mathematics that you needed for the standard model that was not just unknown to physicists but even to mathematicians well technically it's called non-degree engaged theory so uh of course light and electricity and magnetism were known since prehistoric days and in the 19th century they were unified in what is called maxwell's equations by the mathematical physicist james clark maxwell working in scotland and by the early 20th century maxwell's theory was reinterpreted quantum mechanically and then we talked about photons not just electromagnetic fields but maxwell's theory is a linear theory so if i have two flashlight beams they pass through each other without perceptible interactions in modern physics we understand that they interact slightly but that is really not perceptible even with fancy physics laboratories it's not really perceptible under ordinary conditions maxwell's equations are linear but the standard model is based on a non-linear version of maxwell's equations where you have to imagine that the two waves do interact and scatter each other but because they interact they also can't be treated classically the way light waves can be so it has to be treated quantum mechanically and then the standard model becomes much more complicated and the part which is really most complicated is the theory of the nuclear force the strong interactions as we call it where we had the equations by 1973 but solving them as another matter so as a graduate student my main interest was in trying to learn how to solve the equations of the standard model that's a big problem that's still largely unsolved today so of course i was only able to make very limited progress i would say as a student i only made minor contributions the standard model was all based on this non-linear extension of maxwell's theory this non-linear extension of electromagnetic theory which is much richer and perhaps much more interesting both mathematically and physically and it raised many new questions which at first seemed like a side light but gradually they came to be more and more important so in 1976 just the year i was finishing graduate school there was actually a breakthrough in the math of uh non-billion gauge theory applied to these strong interactions which led to you at a new wave of mathematical questions and by the time i got to harvard as opposed to octophile the mathematicians as well were talking more to the physicists then it probably been current for a long time to give a brief answer to your question of what was my journey i started with interest in building models of elementary particle physics but the success of the standard model both by answering some questions and by raising others created a new environment where i found more opportunity exploring some of the mathematical issues arising in the standard model and that set me on a course that gradually led to more and more interactions between math and physics and uh how did that process occur was that um that was prior to your work on string theory it was originally questions arising in the standard model that led to a renewed interaction between physics and math or at least the kind of physics i'm interested in math and that was the story roughly for the first decade then in the mid 80s there was enough progress in string theory so that that led to a completely new arena similar but much wider for the application of physics do you remember the moment that that you had this was it an aha moment that is now going to shift your intellectual pursuit to string theory from what you have been working on the standard model in the mathematics of the standard model well in 1982 and 1983 john schwartz and michael green and lars brink had made enough progress that i was starting to take their work on string theory seriously but it was clear that it was a very long-term proposition exactly like critics say today for the same reason that critics some critics criticized during theory today as being a long-term proposition i felt exactly the same way in 1982 in 1983 and so i hesitated to get fully involved i spent a summer studying john schwartz's review article on string theory it's hard presumably 82 or 83 but it's hard to remember for sure and i did some minor work clarifying some of what they had done were you interacting with them personally i was interacting with them a lot did they take you seriously at that point since you were just coming into the field well one thing that made me hesitate was that it was a very long-term proposition but the other thing was that with the understanding of that time it was impossible to get the elementary particles right because a very important part of elementary particle physics which is the handedness of the elementary particles technically called the parity violation just couldn't come out of string theory so i had innumerable discussions with schwartz and green about this point and they ultimately took me seriously and solved it in a breakthrough in i think august of 1984. and i was sitting at lunch in the faculty club at princeton when a colleague who just got back from aspen mentioned that they achieved this development and at that instant i knew i'd be working on string theory because it was like magic okay i should clarify this to you better there was a whole series of incredible magical turns of events or obstacles in the way of string theory as a consistent theory had gone away previously some of the in the work of french words in 82 and 83 which had gotten me interested and a lot of stuff before that some of it was before michael green had been involved although john schwartz was one of the original pioneers but a lot of this had happened before i was focusing on it and if a discovery is made if a problem is resolved before you knew about the problem it doesn't have the same emotional impact as if a problem is resolved when you've been worried about the problem for a long time so when they achieved the additional breakthrough in august 84 that made the difficulties in at least a rough draft of elementary particle physics go away that had a huge impact on me and i was sure that my interest would never be the same again so by the middle 1980s you were i i turned sort of catching up to where others were yes and and understanding and then when was it the time they began making original controversy well i don't regard it as a breakthrough comparable to what green and schwartz had done because it was i would say relatively obvious but um on that day on august 1984 i understood much better than anybody else why their discovery made it possible to make a semi-realistic part model of the elementary particles after all this particular problem that they resolved i i've been focused on it for years and had done some preliminary work but okay they found the right framework where it could actually be solved in string theory so you you realize that their solution was even maybe more significant than they thought i can't speak for them but some of the detailed implications i think i'd be more comfortable saying it like this some of the more detailed implications of their work were particularly obvious to me that's a nice way to put it and then and then what were then the subsequent contributions that you began making over the next 10 years say well i'll tell you the next six months even so well i i mean i almost immediately wrote a short paper which was kind of relatively obvious given their work as well as what i and others had done before explaining how you could get the quantum numbers as it's called of the elementary particles the the electric charges and other properties of the quarks and leptons during those months it was a very important development by gross harvey martinek and rome who discovered the variance of string theory the heterotic string they discovered two of the five string theories um so the the anomaly cancellation the breakthrough of green and schwartz in 84. three string theories were already known largely because of their work and their breakthrough gave a clue to the discovery of two more but um by early 85 with several co-authors candelas horowitz stromager i wrote a paper giving a more detailed explanation well i would say doing a little bit better in terms of making a model of particle physics from string theory so for a year or two that was my main interest so so by the string of 85 we understood that you could make assumptions about the extra dimensions of string theory that would lead to something a lot like the elementary particles but the more we looked at it the more ways of doing that there were this ultimately led to questions that people asked later about the landscape and you famously in 1995 kind of showed that the five string theories that were existent at the time were really uh limiting cases of really one string theory how how did that come about because when you gave that speech i think it was in santa barbara it caused the stir and changed the way the whole field worked how did that process just caused a stir but realistically i was putting together i added a couple new clues but i was also putting together many clues that have been discovered by colleagues did you know it was going to be that significant when you gave that speech i think i realized by that time that i had something significant but i'd like to tell you the story behind it a little bit so it's one thing in physics to write down the equations but then you have to solve them and that is sometimes easier said than done for example i mentioned earlier that as a graduate student i was obsessed with the fact that the equations of the standard model are so difficult to solve they're so difficult to solve because the quantum effects are big when quantum effects are small you can understand what's going on but when eponymo effects are big it's a mystery by the early 90s it was appreciated largely by my colleague nathan zeiberg who's now here at the institute for vance study that suprasymmetric theories are an example similar to the standard model but simpler mathematically where you can actually sometimes understand the quantum effects when they're big and in 1994 cyborg and i collaborated in what proved to be a particularly interesting instance of this what peop what physicists and mathematicians both call cyborg written theory although what physicists and mathematicians mean by cyber written theory is quite different for physicists it's our success in describing the behavior of a certain quantum field theory at long distances for mathematicians they're referring to the implications for the study of four-dimensional spaces that's perhaps something we can get back to later anyway i had this experience in extrapolating the behavior of quantum systems to strong coupling so what ended up happening was that in 1995 i was successful in doing something similar for string theory i didn't start exactly with that goal what was bothering me at the time was that there were five string theories which were too many um if one of them described our world who lived in the other four worlds so a canonical view at the time was that maybe some of the string theories were mathematically inconsistent because of subtler problems that hadn't been appreciated so in the spring of 1995 i set myself the problem of trying to show that some of the string theories were inconsistent and for a while i thought i'd been successful but at some point i realized and the most interesting aha moment was actually in an airplane on my way back from toronto but anyway at some point i realized that actually there was a loophole in my arguments and the string theories i was trying to get rid of were consistent but to understand their consistency you had to unify the string theories together and also add this new limit that people sometimes call m theory the story that i presented in a lecture at usc university of southern california in 1995 where i sort of unified the string theories really resulted from an attempt to disprove some of them i was trying to reduce the number of string theories by showing that some were inconsistent but what happened instead was to reduce the number of string theories by showing that they were different limits of each other
