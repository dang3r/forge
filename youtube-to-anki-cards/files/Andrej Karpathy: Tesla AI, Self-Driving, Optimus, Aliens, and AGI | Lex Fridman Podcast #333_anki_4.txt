What is the project called where neural networks are given access to a keyboard and a mouse to interact with the internet? ; World of bits
What was the idea behind World of bits? ; To get neural networks to complete bookings and interact with user interfaces using keyboard and mouse.
What is the current approach to training neural networks for World of bits? ; Initializing with GPT, which is pre-trained on text.
What is the final frontier in terms of interacting with the internet? ; Taking in pixels and giving out keyboard and mouse commands.
What is reinforcement learning and why is it inefficient for training neural networks? ; Training neural networks from scratch using reinforcement learning is extremely inefficient because the reward signal is sparse and there are too many possible actions and observations.
What is the status of interest in World of bits now? ; It is garnering renewed interest from companies like Adept and OpenAI.
What is proof of personhood and why might we need it in the future? ; Proof of personhood is a solution for verifying whether an entity is human or digital. We may need it in the future when we share digital space with AI and synthetic beings.
What is the optimism associated with proof of personhood? ; It is possible to create and implement proof of personhood, and it's not an intractable problem.
What is the cost of creating a bot on the internet? ; It is very low, which makes it all the more critical to develop methods for detecting and verifying personhood.
