In this transcript, Slavoj Zizek discusses his belief that happiness is a conformist category that does not factor into creative endeavors. He claims that people do not truly desire happiness and that, in fact, it is an unethical category. Zizek uses the example of a traditional male chauvinist scenario in which a man has a cold wife and a mistress, and thinks that he wants his wife to disappear so he can be with the mistress. Zizek argues that, often when the wife does go away, the man realizes that he didn't really want to be with the mistress but instead wanted to keep her as an object of desire.
