Who did Craig Smith interview in his podcast episode of I on AI? ; Ilya Sutskever, co-founder and chief scientist of OpenAI
What is GPT-3 and why is it significant? ; GPT-3 is a large language model which has been described as "changing the world." It has significant implications for natural language processing and has been used for various applications such as chatbots and text generation.
Who was primarily responsible for the dramatic performance of the convolutional neural network AlexNet in 2012? ; Ilya Sutskever has been credited by Jeff Hinton as the main impetus for AlexNet's success.
What is unsupervised learning and why was it considered the Holy Grail of machine learning before GPT-3? ; Unsupervised learning is a technique in machine learning where a model is trained on data without explicit labels or annotations. The hope was that if unsupervised learning could be fully solved, it would provide a way for machines to learn without the need for human input, resulting in significant advancements in artificial intelligence.
What is the main limitation of large language models like GPT-3? ; The knowledge contained in large language models is primarily contained in the language they are trained on, and does not necessarily relate to or reflect the underlying reality of the world.
