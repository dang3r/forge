The speaker discusses his experience in solving complex equations in physics, particularly in studying the standard model and suprasymmetric theories. In 1994, he collaborated with Nathan Zeiberg in studying the cyborg written theory, which is a success in describing the behavior of a certain quantum field theory at long distances for physicists and refers to the implications for the study of four-dimensional spaces for mathematicians. In 1995, the speaker tried to show that some of the five string theories were inconsistent but ended up unifying them together and adding a new limit called m theory. He presented this story in a lecture at the University of Southern California in 1995.

1. What is the difficulty in solving equations in physics?
2. What are suprasymmetric theories and how are they related to the standard model?
3. What is cyborg written theory and how is it understood differently by physicists and mathematicians?
4. Why did the speaker want to reduce the number of string theories?
5. How did the speaker unify the five string theories?
