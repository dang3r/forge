First names in Canada, 2021 Census of Population – Rank, count and percentage by gender for first names, Canada

Catalogue number: 98-505-X2021007		Release date: 2025-03-19



Notes
The data contained in this product come from the "Given name(s)" field of the 2021 Census of Population form.

The first given name is the name which appears first in the full given name taken from the data source.

Missing first names, those composed of a single letter, those that are entirely composed of numbers and/or special characters and those with a count less than 250 are excluded.

In the source data, first names are presented in a format in which an accented letter is replaced with the unaccented version of the letter. For instance, a name registered as "François" will appear as "Francois".

First names which include a hyphen are kept in full.

Random rounding
To ensure confidentiality, the values, including totals, are randomly rounded either up or down to a multiple of '5' or '10.' To understand these data, you must be aware that each individual value is rounded. As a result, when these data are summed or grouped, the total value may not match the individual values since totals and sub-totals are independently rounded. Similarly, percentages, which are calculated on rounded data, may not necessarily add up to 100%.

Gender
Gender refers to an individual's personal and social identity as a man, woman or non-binary person (a person who is not exclusively a man or a woman).
Gender includes the following concepts:
- gender identity, which refers to the gender that a person feels internally and individually;
- gender expression, which refers to the way a person presents their gender, regardless of their gender identity, through body language, aesthetic choices or accessories (e.g., clothes, hairstyle and makeup), which may have traditionally been associated with a specific gender, and this, regardless of their gender identity.
A person's gender may differ from their sex at birth, and from what is indicated on their current identification or legal documents such as their birth certificate, passport or driver's licence. A person's gender may change over time.
Some people may not identify with a specific gender.
Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is sometimes necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. In these cases, individuals in the category "non-binary persons" are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the "+" symbol.
"Men+" includes men (and/or boys), as well as some non-binary persons.
"Women+" includes women (and/or girls), as well as some non-binary persons.

Count
Number of times a first name was recorded from the census questionnaires, by gender.

Percentage
Percentage is equal to the count of the first name divided by the total number of all first names, for the selected gender.
Percentages may not total 100 percent due to random rounding.

Rank
Place in a set whose elements are classified according to a determined order. A descending rank means that the count of names is ordered from highest to lowest. When two or more different names are tied with the same count for a given year of birth, the equality is preserved and the following name will jump as many ranks as equality between the previous names (e.g., 92, 92, 92, 95).
